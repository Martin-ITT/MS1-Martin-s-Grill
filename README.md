# The Martin's Grill
## Code Institute - MS project 1
--------------------------------------
*The Martin's Grill* is a website which helps a new virtual takeaway restaurant to stand out from other local competitors, to promote its business and attract new customers and update regular customers about new meals and deals.
Most of my professional time I spent in food industry where I got inspiration for this project. I tried to put in all of my experience from different points of view - as a customer but also as restaurant manager and create a website with a proffesional look.

This project has been created as a Milestone Project 1 for Full Stack Web Development Course at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net).

Main requirements:
* to deploy a static web site consisting of at least three pages with responsive design using HTML5 and CSS3. 
* main navigation menu and structured layout
* documentation using README<span>.</span>md and Git & GitHub version control

## Main aims

1. Strategy - to introduce suitable website for local takeaway restaurant to attract potentional customers and stand out from competitors by creating a website with a proffesional look. This will allow company to grow.

1. Scope - to include restaurant menu, contact formular and current offers. Order online feature will be added later.

1. Structure - to fulfil information architecture and to use HTML semantic elements so the search engines can find relevant informations. Links, pictures and other functions to be logically grouped.

1. Skeleton - To create a functional and user friendly navbar and footer with easy navigation so customers can find information they need. 

1. Surface - to implement responsive design with appropriate colors and fonts so the website can be viewed on device with smaller screen size.



## User stories

1. As a business owner I need a website which will provide all relevant information - our products, store locantions and opening time.

1. As a business owner I would like to be accesible throught my website so the customer can contact me and share their ideas or feedback.

1. I am a customer who usually access web on mobile device so attractive layout on a small screen is very important to me.

1. I am a customer who compares prices with other restaurants so I am always looking for a menu page.

1. I am a culinary student looking for a part time position in a restaurant and I'd like to know how can I apply here.

## Design process

Following the user stories I decided to conduct a research on a similar websites to identify suitable architecture and simple navigation for my project. This resulted in having these four pages: 'Home', 'About us', 'Menu', 'Contact Us'.

The 'Home' page content needs to be simple for quick loading and containg nice hero picture making customer stay here and browse further. As I was open to any ideas I searched through dozens of pictures and choosed picture with [Burger&Chips](https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1418586).

New thing to learn for me was making design with wireframing programmes. I came accross [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) but I didn't like its sketch based approach so I sticked with [Figma](http://www.figma.com). Instant results in Figma are realistic what helped me while selecting ideal color scheme for my project.

Throughout various stages of my project development I changed the company name, logo, hero image and content of pages but I tried to stick with initial purpose, main aims and user stories.
