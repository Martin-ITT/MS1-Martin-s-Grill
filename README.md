# The Martin's Grill
## Code Institute - MS project 1
--------------------------------------
*The Martin's Grill* is a website which will help a local restaurant to stand out from other competitors, to promote its business and attract new customers and update regular customers about new meals and offers.
Most of my professional time I spent in food industry where I got inspiration for this project. I tried to put in all of my experience from different points of view - as a customer but also as restaurant manager and create an attractive website with a proffesional look.

This project has been created as a Milestone Project 1 for Full Stack Web Development Course at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net).

Main requirements:
* to deploy a static web site consisting of at least three pages with responsive design using HTML5 and CSS3. 
* main navigation menu and structured layout
* documentation using README<span>.</span>md and Git & GitHub version control

# 1. UX 👌
## Main aims
### 1.1 Who is this website for? 👪

This website is focused on local customers to find out what meals are available and to engage with it community and to attract potentional customers.

- Strategy - to introduce suitable website for local takeaway restaurant to attract potentional customers and stand out from competitors by creating a website with a proffesional look. This will allow company to grow.

- Scope - to include restaurant menu, contact formular and current offers. To introduce our team and our believes.

- Structure - to fulfil information architecture and to use HTML semantic elements so the search engines can find relevant informations. Links, pictures and other functions to be logically grouped.

- Skeleton - To create a functional and user friendly navbar and footer with easy navigation so customers can find information they need. 

- Surface - to implement responsive design with appropriate colors and fonts so the website can be viewed on device with smaller screen size.



## 1.2 What we want? ❓
### User stories

This project has an agile approach and we will focus on both external and internal clients of this website.

- As a business owner I need a website which will provide all relevant information - our products, store location and opening time.

- As a business owner I need good looking home page with easy navigation and direct option to order. 

- As a business owner I would like to be accesible throught my website so the customer can contact me and share their ideas or feedback.

- I am a customer who usually access web on mobile device responsive layout on a small screen is very important to me.

- I am a customer who wants to know what meals are available so I am always looking for a menu page.

- I am a culinary student looking for a part time position in a restaurant and I'd like to know how can I apply here.

- I often use social media to engage with a community so I am looking for Facebook and Twitter logos.

- I prefer to have a table booked rather than just walk-in. I'd like to see a booking feature.

## 1.3 How it was done? 🚧
### Design process

Following the user stories I decided to conduct a research on a similar websites to identify suitable architecture and easy navigation for my project. This resulted in consistent simple navbar on top and footer providing requested functions. The content was divided into four main pages: 'Home' page with option to place an order, 'About Us' page introducing the restaurant, 'Menu' page with the meals and prices and 'Contact Us' with contact details.

All content needs to be simple for quick loading and containg nice hero picture or animation engaging with customers and make them browse further. As I was open to any ideas the project started by searching through dozens of pictures. After a while I choosed this lovely picture of [Burger](https://www.pexels.com/photo/hamburger-with-egg-and-vegetable-1251198/). While working on this project I kept checking other webs and change this idea to more appealing animation.
New challenge to learn was to create a design with wireframing programmes. I came accross [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) but I didn't like its sketch based approach so I sticked with [Figma](http://www.figma.com). Instant results in Figma are realistic what helped me while selecting ideal color scheme for my project. Hovewer, after a conversation on Slack with a developers community I believe I will be also using pen & paper.

Throughout various stages of my project development I changed the company name, logo, hero image and content of pages but I was focusing to stick with initial purpose, main aims and user stories.

I developed this project in VS Code. Code was pushed using GitBash into GitHub repository in my account. Following steps needs to be followed:

1. Create a repository inside GitHub
2. Create a project in VS Code
3. Project / Folder needs to be linked with repository using GitBash.
4. Code can now be written in VS Code
5. Code needs to be commited and pushed regularly. This allows for version control.

Deployed version of this project is exactly the same as devolper version. This is located in master branch.
